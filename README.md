Target Time +/- 120 minutes

The app is here .

**Step 2**
Set up a new github repo for this project, including setting it up for automation.

See the last practice from today for help here if needed.

**Step 3**
Consider what methods you’d want in a page object, and create your page object to test first.

**Step 4**
Using the page object, write up at least one test for Enter Wanted.

**Step 5**
Add a picture/text file of your equivalence partitions into the repository for our reference.
In the comments of your test(s) include the url(s) to the corresponding Jira test case(s).

**Submission**
Commit and push your changes up to github, and submit a link to the repository containing this automation.

**Solution**
Existing automation projects should provide you with all the examples you need.

Stretch
Get some data driven testing going on using JSON files!
Use JSDoc to thoroughly comment your page object.
